The order does not have to match the order in the index (and most likely, it indeed won't).</p><p>The important thing is that the index items are <strong>ordered</strong> (ascending or descending - depending on how you created the index). <code>createIndex({age: 1})</code> creates an index with <strong>ascending sorting</strong>, <code>createIndex({age: -1})</code> creates one with <strong>descending</strong> <strong>sorting</strong>.</p><p>MongoDB is now able to quickly find a fitting document when you filter for its age as it has a sorted list. Sorted lists are way quicker to search because you can skip entire ranges (and don't have to look at every single document).</p><p>Additionally, sorting (via <code>sort(...)</code>) will also be sped up because you already have a sorted list. Of course this is only true when sorting for the age.</p><p><br></p></p>
